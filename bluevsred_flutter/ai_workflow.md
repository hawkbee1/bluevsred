Please follow these guidelines for all responses related to my Flutter/Flame game project:

1. Architecture: Always follow clean code principles with proper separation of concerns
2. Components: Use Flame's component-based architecture consistently
3. Game Loop: Consider performance implications in the game loop
4. Testing: Include unit tests for core game mechanics. Widget testing includes widget screenshots for each step and for different screen type (desktop, phone, tablet)
5. Documentation: Add code comments explaining complex logic
6. Iterations: For each new feature, cover design, implementation, check code (flutter analyze), update code until flutter analyze command return no complaint,  testing phases (flutter test), test coverage, update code until test coverae is 100% 
7. File Structure: Follow the aclean code project organization
