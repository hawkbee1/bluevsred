# Blue vs Red

You are a commander who lead his section to kill the ennemy Headquarters together with his company and the whole army. Will you choose red or blue army?   


## Game Presentation
Blue vs Red is a persistent, cross-platform wargame where players take command of a military section and engage in strategic combat across a dynamic, multiplayer battlefield. Originally known as Assaut & Strat√©gie, the game has evolved into a modern, streamlined experience now available on web, Android, iPhone, macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.

The game simulates a large-scale war between two factions‚ÄîBlue and Red‚Äîwith each player controlling a squad of soldiers. Units have distinct roles (such as rifleman, sniper, heavy gunner, scout, or medic) and operate with action points used to move, fire, heal, or perform tactical maneuvers.

Gameplay unfolds in real time, often over several days or weeks. Players must manage line-of-sight, cover, terrain, and coordination with allied squads. The battlefield is persistent, meaning your decisions have lasting consequences, and teamwork is essential to achieving both tactical victories and long-term strategic goals.

The game's depth, realism, and cooperative mechanics make it a unique experience for fans of tactical combat and strategic planning.

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the Rules and Resources section, or if you'd like to expand on other areas like factions, unit types, or victory conditions.

## Rules and Resources
Blue vs Red is built around core mechanics that emphasize strategy, coordination, and realism. Each player commands a section composed of several units‚Äîtypically between 4 to 6 soldiers‚Äîeach with specific roles and capabilities. The rules are simple in concept, but allow for deep tactical gameplay.

## üéØ Objectives
Global Goal: Help your team (Blue or Red) dominate the battlefield by completing missions, capturing strategic zones, and inflicting maximum losses on the opposing side.

Squad-Level Goal: Support allied squads, engage enemy units, survive, and complete specific assignments (e.g. escort, ambush, recon, defend).

## üéÆ Turn and Action System
The game runs in real-time turns with each turn lasting a set number of minutes (e.g. 10 minutes per turn).

Each unit has action points (AP) which replenish gradually over time.

Actions like moving, shooting, healing, or changing posture (e.g., crouch, prone) consume AP.

Players can log in anytime to issue orders for the current or upcoming turns.

## Combat and Visibility
Line-of-sight (LOS) and terrain (forests, hills, buildings) are crucial. A unit can't shoot what it can't see.

Weapons have realistic stats: accuracy, range, rate of fire, and ammunition.

Visibility depends on factors like light, cover, unit posture, and movement.

Damage is location-based: hits to the legs, arms, or torso have different consequences (immobilization, reduced effectiveness, or death).

## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èUnit Types and Roles
Typical unit types include:

**Rifleman** ‚Äì versatile, balanced AP and firepower.

**Sniper** ‚Äì long-range accuracy, low rate of fire.

**Machine** Gunner ‚Äì suppressive fire, area denial.

**Medic** ‚Äì can heal or stabilize allies.

**Scout** ‚Äì high mobility, reduced visibility range for enemies.

**Engineer or Demolition** ‚Äì may handle explosives or mission-specific tools.

Players select their squad composition at the start and may be able to change it between missions.

## üí¨ Communication & Teamplay
A large part of the game revolves around team coordination.

Players communicate via an in-game chat system and forums, sometimes supported by maps with shared markings or orders.

Structured command hierarchies can exist, with higher-ranked players issuing broad orders or organizing joint operations.

## üìö Resources
A community-maintained wiki contains detailed rules, unit stats, and tactical guides.

Players often share tutorials and AARs (after-action reports) on forums and social media.

New players are guided through an in-game tutorial and can join training missions.

Let me know if you want to continue with the next section: Community and Support, or dive into specific areas like unit stats, tactics, or terrain types.

There is no turns. Each units can have 30 Action Points max dans recover, by default, 1 AP /h

üìò Rules and Resources
Blue vs Red operates as a continuous, real-time wargame‚Äînot turn-based. Each player controls a squad composed of multiple military units, maneuvering across a persistent battlefield in pursuit of tactical and strategic objectives.

üïí Action Points (AP) System
Every unit has a maximum of 30 Action Points (AP).

Units recover AP automatically at a rate of 1 AP per hour (by default).

Actions such as movement, shooting, healing, demolitions, and radio communication consume varying amounts of AP.

Players can issue commands at any time; actions are executed immediately if enough AP is available.

üéØ Objectives
Each team (Blue and Red) has a Headquarters (HQ) on the map.

Primary Goal: Destroy the enemy HQ while protecting your own.

HQs can be moved, though very slowly, making them vulnerable and strategic targets.

Secondary objectives include map control, supporting allies, and denying enemy movements.

üî≠ Visibility and Terrain
Units can only see and shoot within line of sight, which is affected by:

Elevation

Obstacles (e.g., forests, hills, urban areas)

Unit posture and equipment

Some units (like scouts or observers) are specialized for reconnaissance and extended visibility.

üíÇ Unit Types
There are a wide variety of unit types, each with specific roles, strengths, and weaknesses. Here's the current roster:

Unit	Notes (short summary)
moto	Fast, lightly armed unit for scouting
obs	Observer; provides enhanced visibility
GB	Likely a heavy infantry or elite unit
forteress	Heavy stationary or slow-moving unit, defensive
jeep	Light, fast vehicle with limited firepower
Leclerc	French heavy tank
Challenger	British heavy tank
LAV	Light Armored Vehicle; mobility + firepower
AMX	French armored unit (e.g. AMX-10, AMX-30)
warrior	British infantry fighting vehicle
soldier	Standard infantry
commando	Stealthy or high-damage infantry unit
veteran	Experienced soldier, likely better stats
kamikaze	Suicide unit; high damage, self-destructive
marine	Elite infantry, possibly amphibious or assault
engineer	Handles repairs, construction or traps
dragon	Likely an AT specialist (e.g., Dragon ATGM)
vbci	French armored personnel carrier
medic	Can heal wounded units
radio	Communication relay; may coordinate strikes
dynamiter	Specializes in demolition, likely against HQs

(If you want, I can create a table with stats or tactical roles for each.)

ü§ù Coordination & Teamplay
Players can communicate via chat and shared maps.

Radio units may play a role in relaying positions, targeting, or commands across the team.

Advanced squads coordinate flanks, ambushes, or HQ strikes together.

Leadership structures may form organically, especially in organized groups.

üìö Learning and Support
The game offers a tutorial and players often learn through mentorship and community resources.

A wiki and player-made guides (tactical, role-specific, survival, etc.) help new players understand the complex dynamics.

Would you like the next section to be Community and Support, or should we expand the unit descriptions into a full breakdown with tactical usage, AP costs, speed, and more?

give values to firepower, range (same signification as sight. Most units can't fire farther than their sight except for artillery), weight (will have impact on ground type the unit can go) and camouflage (diminish sight of enemy to spot them). Infirmier (medic in fact), sapeur (engineer), campement and  transports don't have fire power and range.

Would you like to proceed with values for Movement AP Cost, Attack AP Cost, and Size next? 







Vous avez dit¬†:
Wrong. fire power can't be 0, it's Non Applicable. I don't see values for camouflage and weight. Range (how far I can attack) and sight how far I can see) are different things. Their is also the most important unit for a player which is the commander (no cost, return to camp of the battalion when killed.).
