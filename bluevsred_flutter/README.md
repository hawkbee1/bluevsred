ðŸ§  Game Presentation
Blue vs Red is a persistent, cross-platform wargame where players take command of a military section and engage in strategic combat across a dynamic, multiplayer battlefield. Originally known as Assaut & StratÃ©gie, the game has evolved into a modern, streamlined experience now available on web, Android, iPhone, macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.

The game simulates a large-scale war between two factionsâ€”Blue and Redâ€”with each player controlling a squad of soldiers. Units have distinct roles (such as rifleman, sniper, heavy gunner, scout, or medic) and operate with action points used to move, fire, heal, or perform tactical maneuvers.

Gameplay unfolds in real time, often over several days or weeks. Players must manage line-of-sight, cover, terrain, and coordination with allied squads. The battlefield is persistent, meaning your decisions have lasting consequences, and teamwork is essential to achieving both tactical victories and long-term strategic goals.

The game's depth, realism, and cooperative mechanics make it a unique experience for fans of tactical combat and strategic planning.

ðŸ“˜ Rules and Resources
Blue vs Red operates as a continuous, real-time wargameâ€”not turn-based. Each player controls a squad composed of multiple military units, maneuvering across a persistent battlefield in pursuit of tactical and strategic objectives.

ðŸ•’ Action Points (AP) System
Every unit has a maximum of 30 Action Points (AP).

Units recover AP automatically at a rate of 1 AP per hour (by default).

Actions such as movement, shooting, healing, demolitions, and radio communication consume varying amounts of AP.

Players can issue commands at any time; actions are executed immediately if enough AP is available.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Each team (Blue and Red) has a Headquarters (HQ) on the map.

Primary Goal: Destroy the enemy HQ while protecting your own.

HQs can be moved, though very slowly, making them vulnerable and strategic targets.

Secondary objectives include map control, supporting allies, and denying enemy movements.

ðŸ”­ Visibility and Terrain
Units can only see and shoot within line of sight, which is affected by:

Elevation

Obstacles (e.g., forests, hills, urban areas)

Unit posture and equipment

Some units (like scouts or observers) are specialized for reconnaissance and extended visibility.

ðŸ’‚ Unit Types
